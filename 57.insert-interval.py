# Testcase Example:  '[[1,3],[6,9]]\n[2,5]'
#
# You are given an array of non-overlapping intervals intervals where
# intervals[i] = [starti, endi] represent the start and the end of the i^th
# interval and intervals is sorted in ascending order by starti. You are also
# given an interval newInterval = [start, end] that represents the start and
# end of another interval.
#
# Insert newInterval into intervals such that intervals is still sorted in
# ascending order by starti and intervals still does not have any overlapping
# intervals (merge overlapping intervals if necessary).
#
# Return intervals after the insertion.
#
# Note that you don't need to modify intervals in-place. You can make a new
# array and return it.
#
#
# Example 1:
#
#
# Input: intervals = [[1,3],[6,9]], newInterval = [2,5]
# Output: [[1,5],[6,9]]
#
#
# Example 2:
#
#
# Input: intervals = [[1,2],[3,5],[6,7],[8,10],[12,16]], newInterval = [4,8]
# Output: [[1,2],[3,10],[12,16]]
# Explanation: Because the new interval [4,8] overlaps with
# [3,5],[6,7],[8,10].
#
#
#
# Constraints:
#
#
# 0 <= intervals.length <= 10^4
# intervals[i].length == 2
# 0 <= starti <= endi <= 10^5
# intervals is sorted by starti in ascending order.
# newInterval.length == 2
# 0 <= start <= end <= 10^5
